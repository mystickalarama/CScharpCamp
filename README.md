💾 <span Color="rgb(109, 101, 178)">01_MainSubjects</span>
Here, we learn about our main topics and start our training by printing them to the console.

💾 <span Color="rgb(109, 101, 178)">02_Variables</span>
Building on the int and string variables we saw in the first lesson, we explored other fundamental variable types and applied various operations to them. We also learned how to take user input and perform type conversions.

💾 <span Color="rgb(109, 101, 178)">03_MakingDecision</span>
We learned about decision-making structures such as if-else and switch-case, and we applied them by creating a simple menu and a four-operation calculator.

💾 <span Color="rgb(109, 101, 178)">04_Loops</span>
We studied for and while loops, integrating them with the concepts we had learned in previous lessons.

💾 <span Color="rgb(109, 101, 178)">05_LoopsWithStars</span>
In this lesson, we used the asterisk symbol (*) to create various patterns using loops. Creating these patterns helps in understanding programming logic, practicing loops and conditions, and developing systematic problem-solving skills.

💾 <span Color="rgb(109, 101, 178)">06_Arrays</span>
With this lesson, we introduced arrays. We learned how to print arrays, let users create them, and explored methods such as Min, Max, and IndexOf.

💾 <span Color="rgb(109, 101, 178)">07_ForeachLoop</span>
We explored the foreach loop and discovered how useful it is, especially when working with arrays and lists. We also illustrated its usage with a small quiz system.

💾 <span Color="rgb(109, 101, 178)">08_Methods</span>
In this lesson, we introduced methods, covering different types such as those that return values, those that do not, and methods with or without parameters. We reinforced our learning with various examples.
